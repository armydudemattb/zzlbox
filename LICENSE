The ZZLBox frontend license.

Terminology.
The ZZLBox project consists of the two main parts:
 * Backend. Server side app. Propiatary code. No plans to release it.
 * Frontend. Javascript based. This license is for it.
 
You're free to fork this code and do whatever your want with as long as the following conditions are met:
 * The main purpose of your work is to extend/imporove the basic functionality of ZZLBox frontend. 
 * The application connects to ZZLBox servers only in order to get files to download/stream. Other media such as detailed info or torrent metafiles can be fetched from any source. I.e. you cannot create a clone of zzlbox server app and use this frontend.
 * All source code is open, documented and available through a git based repository such as github.com

If in doubt please ask ZZLBox admin first.

For everything else default copyright law apply.
